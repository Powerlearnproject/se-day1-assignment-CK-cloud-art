Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaing software using engineering priciples. It is important because it helps in the creation of reliable, efficient, and sclable software that empowers industries like healthcare, communication, entertainment and customer experience. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- 1950s – Birth of Software Engineering
- Early computers used basic programming, but software was not well-structured.
- 1970s – Structured Programming & SDLC
   Developers started using structured programming, making code easier to read and maintain. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was introduced.
- 2000s – Agile methodologies
   Agile methodologies became popular, allowing for faster and flexible software development. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning – Gathering the user needs and requirements.
- Design – Create system architecture and user interface design.
- Implementation (Coding) – Write the actual code.
- Testing – Check for errors and bugs.
- Deployment – Release the software for use.
- Maintenance – Fix issues and update the softwar

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a step-by-step approach where each phase (like planning, designing, coding, testing, and deployment) is completed before moving to the next. Once a step is finished, you cannot go back to make changes.

Example Scenario:
A banking system that requires strict documentation and security. Since requirements are clear from the start, it is best to follow a structured process.

Agile Methodology
Agile is a flexible approach where work is done in small parts and improved continuously based on feedback. Changes can be made anytime.

Example Scenario:
A mobile app where users' needs may change, and new features must be added regularly. Agile allows the team to adjust based on feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer – Writes and maintains the code.
- Quality Assurance Engineer – Tests software to find bugs.
- Project Manager – Plans, organizes, and ensures the project is completed on time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help developers write, test, and debug code in one place.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA

- Version Control Systems (VCS) track code changes and allow collaboration.
Examples: Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirement – effective communication
- Keeping Up with New Technologies – Take online courses and read documentation.
- Meeting Deadlines – Break tasks into smaller parts and use project management tools.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing – Tests small parts (functions) of code.
2. Integration Testing – Ensures different parts of the software work together.
3. System Testing – Tests the entire system for errors.
4. Acceptance Testing – Ensures software meets user requirements before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective inputs (prompts) to get the best responses from AI models. It is important because well-crafted prompts improve AI-generated results, making AI more useful for tasks like coding, writing, and automation.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Write about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming customer service in online businesses. Provide examples of AI tools and their impact on customer experience."

- Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
- Specific  – Instead of a broad term like "technology," it focuses on AI in customer service.
- Clear  – It defines what to cover (AI tools, transformation, and impact).
- Concise  – The writer knows exactly what to research and explain.
